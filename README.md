# Array Generation Function

This JavaScript function generates an array of numbers between two given numbers.

## Function Description

The function `generateArrayBetween(start, end)` accepts two numbers `start` and `end` as input and returns an array containing all the numbers between them, inclusive.

If `start` is less than `end`, the function generates an array starting from `start` up to `end`.

If `start` is greater than `end`, the function generates an array starting from `start` down to `end`.

## Examples

```javascript
console.log(generateArrayBetween(5, 8));  // Output: [5, 6, 7, 8]
console.log(generateArrayBetween(-5, 8)); // Output: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

#Usage
You can use this function to generate arrays of numbers for various purposes, such as creating number ranges for iteration, testing, or data manipulation.

javascript
const myArray = generateArrayBetween(1, 10); // Generates an array from 1 to 10



# String Case Swapper

This JavaScript function swaps the case of each character in a given string.

## Function Description

The function `swapCase(inputString)` accepts a string `inputString` as input and returns a new string with the case of each character swapped.

## Implementation Details

1. The input string is converted to an array of characters using the `split()` method.
2. Then, each character in the array is iterated over.
3. For each character:
   - If it is a letter (a-zA-Z), its case is swapped using conditional logic.
4. Finally, the array of characters is joined back into a string using the `join()` method.

##Example

```javascript
const inputString = 'The Fastest Man Alive';
const swappedString = swapCase(inputString);
console.log(swappedString); // Output: 'tHE fASTEST mAN aLIVE'


##Usage Notes

You can use this function to swap the case of each character in a string. It's useful for various text processing tasks, such as normalizing text inputs or manipulating text output.



#Prime Number Filter

This JavaScript function filters out prime numbers from an array of numbers while maintaining their original order.

## Function Description

The function `filterPrimes(numbers)` accepts an array of numbers `numbers` as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.

## Implementation Details

1. The function `isPrime(num)` is a helper function used to check if a number is prime.
2. It iterates through each number in the input array.
3. For each number, it checks if it is prime using the `isPrime` helper function.
4. If the number is prime, it adds it to the output array.
5. Finally, it returns the output array containing only prime numbers.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const inputArray = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20];
const primeNumbers = filterPrimes(inputArray);
console.log(primeNumbers); // Output: [11, 13, 17, 19]

Usage Notes
You can use this function to efficiently filter out prime numbers from an array of numbers, preserving their original order. It's useful for tasks such as finding prime numbers in a dataset or processing numerical data.
